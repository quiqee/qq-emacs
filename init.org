#+TITLE: Emacs configuration file
#+AUTHOR: QuiQee

* About
   This is an Emacs configuration file written in =org-mode=. There are a few
   reaons why I wanted to do this. I wanted to learn =org-mode=, one way to do
   this is by practicing on file I'm often work with. I just started using emacs
   a couple of weeks ago. When I saw an Emacs configuration done in =org-mode=,
   I knew this is what I wanted to do. This way I could gain more knowledge of
   Emacs as I added new stuff here from where ever I can gather from the web.

   *This is live document, always work in progress*

** How does it work?
   =org-mode= support code block exports through a process called =tangle=. This
   document have a global setting that will enable =tangle= on all code block
   except for code block marked with =:tangle no=. The resulting code is stored
   in =~/.emacs.d/init.el=. A compiled code will also be produced. Take a look
   at [[Tangling Function]] for more details.

   You can find more information about *Literate Programming* and *org-mode*
   here:

** Dot Emacs
   Most of the settings below are copied from all over the interweb. Some
   notable dot-emacs that I copied most are from:

   - [[https://github.com/larstvei/dot-emacs][larstvei dot-emacs]] :: this is where I get the idea to start using
        =org-mode= as my dot-emacs file
   - [[https://github.com/dakrone/dakrone-dotfiles/blob/master/.emacs.d/settings.org][dakrone-dotfiles]] :: some of the settings there are a bit outdated, but
        there are still plenty of gems to reuse.
   - [[https://github.com/bling/dotemacs][bling/dotemacs]] :: Knowing =evil-mode= is what I made me switch from Vim to
        Emacs. Bling =evil-mode= settings are used extensively here.
   - [[https://github.com/waymondo/hemacs][waymondo/hemacs]] :: Another dot-emacs settings that I refer to. Make me
        think hard about using =use-package=
   - [[https://github.com/steckerhalter/steckemacs/blob/master/steckemacs.org][steckerhalter/steckemacs]] :: I love the way he use table for keybindings
   - [[https://github.com/joedicastro/dotfiles/tree/master/emacs][joedicastro/emacs]] :: just found out about this.

*** Tangling Function
   Emacs can only load =.el=-files. We can use =C-c C-v t= to run
   =org-babel-tangle=, which extracts the code blocks from the current file
   into a source-specific file (in this case a =.el=-file).

   To avoid doing this each time a change is made we can add a function to
   the =after-save-hook= ensuring to always tangle and byte-compile the
   =org=-document after changes.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (defun qq/tangle-init ()
       "If the current buffer is 'init.org' the code-blocks are
     tangled, and the tangled file is compiled."
     (when (or
              (equal (buffer-file-name)
                  (expand-file-name (concat user-emacs-directory "init.org")))
              (equal (buffer-file-name)
                     (expand-file-name "~/Documents/qq-emacs/init.org")))
         (org-babel-tangle)
         (byte-compile-file (concat user-emacs-directory "init.el"))))

     (add-hook 'after-save-hook 'qq/tangle-init)
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:
   : byte-compile-file

   To export to other format, just press =C-c C-e=, which will display further
   option to choose output format like HTML, PDF or LaTeX.

*** Personal Custom group
   Create a custom group to group any custom variable so it will not
   polute built in variable space

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (defgroup qq nil
       "Personal Custom configuration."
       :group 'local)
   #+END_SRC

   Add a cache-directory root folder custom variable

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (defcustom qq/cache-directory
       (concat user-emacs-directory ".cache/")
       "The storage location for various persistent files."
       :group 'qq)
   #+END_SRC

*** Custom =load-path=
   The variable =load-path= lists all the directories where Emacs should look
   for Elisp files. The first file found is used, therefore the order of the
   directories is relevant.

   =load-path= is documented in the [[info:emacs#Lisp%20Libraries][Emacs Manual]] or [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Lisp-Libraries.html][Emacs Online Manual]], in
   chapter *Libraries of Lisp Code for Emacs*. Useful tips are also on
   [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/LoadPath][EmacsWiki]].

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (let ((default-directory (concat user-emacs-directory "elisp")))
       (unless (file-exists-p default-directory)
         (make-directory default-directory))
       (add-to-list 'load-path default-directory))
   #+END_SRC

Here we create the directory =~/.emacs.d/elisp= if it does not exist, add it to
the =load-path=. Doing that any =.el= or =.elc= files in this directory can be
required from *emacs*.

*** Miscelaneaus Macros & Functions
   Convenient macro to allow processing after checking existing pre-condition

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (defmacro after (feature &rest body)
                    "After FEATURE is loaded, evaluate BODY."
                    (declare (indent defun))
                    `(eval-after-load ,feature
                       '(progn ,@body)))
   #+END_SRC

*** Custom Cache
   Set custom file config to store any cutomized settings. Create one when not
   exist.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (setq custom-file (concat user-emacs-directory "custom.el"))
     (when (file-exists-p custom-file)
       (load custom-file))
   #+END_SRC

** Packages
   Managing extensions for Emacs is simplified using =package= which
   is built in to Emacs 24 and newer. To load downloaded packages we
   need to initialize =package=.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (require 'package)
     (setq package-enable-at-startup nil)
     (package-initialize)
   #+END_SRC

   Packages can be fetched from different mirrors, melpa is the largest
   archive and is well maintained.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (setq package-archives
           '(("melpa" . "http://melpa.milkbox.net/packages/")
             ("org" . "http://orgmode.org/elpa/")
             ("gnu" . "http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/")
             ("marmalade" . "http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/")
            ))
   #+END_SRC

   Let's write a function to install a package if it is not installed or
   upgrades it if a new version has been released. Here our predicate comes
   in handy.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (defun require-package (package)
       "Install given PACKAGE."
       (unless (package-installed-p package)
         (unless (assoc package package-archive-contents)
           (package-refresh-contents))
         (package-install package)))
   #+END_SRC

   Now we can use the function above to make sure packages are installed and
   up to date. Here are some packages I find useful (some of these
   configurations are also dependent on them).

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (defcustom fave-packages

** TODO Require
   Some features are not loaded by default to minimize initialization time,
   so they have to be required (or loaded, if you will). =require=-calls
   tends to lead to the largest bottleneck's in a
   configuration. =idle-reqire= delays the =require=-calls to a time where
   Emacs is in idle. So this is great for stuff you eventually want to load,
   but is not a high priority.

   Some variables are buffer-local, so changing them using =setq= will only
   change them in a single buffer. Using =setq-default= we change the
   buffer-local variable's default value.

   We don't really need to garbage collect as frequently as Emacs would like to
   by default, so set the threshold up hight.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp

   #+end_src

   Echo commands I haven't finished quicker than the default of 1 second:

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (setq echo-keystrokes 0.1)
   #+end_src

   If you change buffer, or focus, disable the current buffer's mark:

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (transient-mark-mode t)
   #+end_src

   Ignore case when using completion for file names:

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (setq read-file-name-completion-ignore-case t)
   #+end_src

   It's so much easier to move around lines based on how they are displayed,
   rather than the actual line. This helps a tone with long log file lines that
   may be wrapped:

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (setq line-move-visual t)
   #+end_src

   Hide the mouse while typing:

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (setq make-pointer-invisible t)
   #+end_src

*** Fixed/Variable Width Faces
   I love monospaced fonts (I used =PragmataPro= extensively), but they can be
   harder to read when it comes to documentation or simple conversation.

   So, let's make Emacs use different fonts (monospaced and variable) depending
   on the mode we're in (eg: Info and ERC should not be monospaced)

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'variable-pitch-mode)
     (add-hook 'erc-mode-hook 'variable-pitch-mode)
     (add-hook 'Info-mode-hook 'variable-pitch-mode)
   #+end_src

   For =org-mode= we'll be using monospace font for formula, meta-line, tables
   and code blocks, while still using =variable-pitch-mode= in the rest of
   =org-mode= buffers

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (defun qq/adjoin-to-list-or-symbol (element list-or-symbol)
       (let ((list (if (not (listp list-or-symbol))
                       (list list-or-symbol)
                     list-or-symbol)))
         (require 'cl-lib)
         (cl-adjoin element list)))

               (set-face-attribute face nil :font "PragmataPro for Powerline-11"
                                   :inherit (qq/adjoin-to-list-or-symbol
                                             'fixed-pitch

                                           'fixed-pitch

** Advice
   An advice can be given to a function to make it behave differently. This
   advice makes =eval-last-sexp= (bound to =C-x C-e=) replace the sexp with
   the value.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
   (defadvice eval-last-sexp (around replace-sexp (arg) activate)
     "Replace sexp when called with a prefix argument."
     (if arg
         (let ((pos (point)))
           ad-do-it
           (goto-char pos)
           (backward-kill-sexp)
           (forward-sexp))
       ad-do-it))
   #+END_SRC

   When interactively changing the theme (using =M-x load-theme=), the
   current custom theme is not disabled. This often gives weird-looking
   results; we can advice =load-theme= to always disable themes currently
   enabled themes.

   are displayed, and =flx-ido-mode= enables fuzzy matching.

** Volatile Highlight
   This package highlights changes to the buffer caused by commands such as
   ‘undo’, ‘yank’/’yank-pop’, etc. The highlight disappears at the next command.
   The highlighting gives useful visual feedback for what your operation
   actually changed in the buffer.

* Mac OS X
   For GUI apps, OS environment variables do not inherit from =shell=. As such,
   for certain things to work smoothly, we use =exec-path-from-shell= to include
   environment-variables from the =shell=. It makes using Emacs along with
   external processes a lot simpler. See [[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16676826/making-the-path-and-other-environment-variables-available-in-emacs][Making the PATH and other environment
   variables available in emacs]]. I also prefer using the =Command=-key as the
   =Meta=-key.

   On Mac OS X, menu bar always exist. No point removing it.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (when (memq window-system '(mac ns))
       (require-package 'exec-path-from-shell)
       (require 'ucs-normalize)
       (setq mac-option-modifier nil
             mac-command-modifier 'meta

             ;; Some mac-bindings interfere with Emacs bindings.
             mac-pass-command-to-system nil
             x-select-enable-clipboard t)

       (menu-bar-mode t)
       (run-with-idle-timer 5 nil 'exec-path-from-shell-initialize)
       (add-hook 'after-init-hook
                 (lambda ()
                   (exec-path-from-shell-copy-env "SSH_AGENT_PID")
                   (exec-path-from-shell-copy-env "SSH_AUTH_SOCK")
                   )))
   #+END_SRC

* TODO Language Modes
** General
   Some general settings that should apply to all programming mode. Highlight
   =FIXME= and =TODO= so they stand out. Also enable indent-guide mode

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (defun qq/add-watchwords ()
       (font-lock-add-keywords
        nil '(("\\<\\(FIXME\\|TODO\\|NOCOMMIT\\)\\>"
               1 '((:foreground "orange") (:weight bold)) t))))

     (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook
               '(lambda()
                  (qq/add-watchwords)
                  (require 'indent-guide)
                  (indent-guide-mode t)
                  (color-identifiers-mode t)))
   #+end_src

** Lisp
   =Pretty-lambda= provides a customizable variable
   =pretty-lambda-auto-modes= that is a list of common lisp modes. Here we
   can add some extra lisp-modes. We run the =pretty-lambda-for-modes=
   function to activate =pretty-lambda-mode= in lisp modes.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (dolist (mode '(slime-repl-mode geiser-repl-mode))
       (add-to-list 'pretty-lambda-auto-modes mode))

     (pretty-lambda-for-modes)
   #+END_SRC

   I use =Paredit= when editing lisp code, we enable this for all lisp-modes
   in the =pretty-lambda-auto-modes= list.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (dolist (mode pretty-lambda-auto-modes)
       ;; add paredit-mode to all mode-hooks
       (add-hook (intern (concat (symbol-name mode) "-hook")) 'paredit-mode))
   #+END_SRC

*** Emacs Lisp

    In =emacs-lisp-mode= we can enable =eldoc-mode= to display information
    about a function or a variable in the echo area.

    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      (require 'elisp-slime-nav)
      (defun qq/lisp-hook ()
        (progn
          (elisp-slime-nav-mode)
          (eldoc-mode)))

      (add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook 'qq/lisp-hook)
      (add-hook 'lisp-interaction-mode-hook 'qq/lisp-hook)
      (add-hook 'ielm-mode-hook 'qq/lisp-hook)
    #+END_SRC

** Java and C
   The =c-mode-common-hook= is a general hook that work on all C-like
   languages (C, C++, Java, etc...). I like being able to quickly compile
   using =C-c C-c= (instead of =M-x compile=), a habit from =latex-mode=.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (defun qq/c-mode-init ()
       (local-set-key (kbd "C-c C-c") 'compile)
       ;; To re-format c code. use C-x h M-C-\ (this puts the region around
       ;; the entire buffer, and then runs the indent-region command).
       (c-set-style "stroustrup")   ; C indenting style
       ;(c-set-offset 'statement-cont 0)
       (flycheck-mode))

     (add-hook 'c-mode-common-hook 'qq/c-mode-init)
   #+END_SRC

   Some statements in Java appear often, and become tedious to write
   out. We can use abbrevs to speed this up.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
   (define-abbrev-table 'java-mode-abbrev-table
     '(("psv" "public static void main(String[] args) {" nil 0)
       ("sopl" "System.out.println" nil 0)
       ("sop" "System.out.printf" nil 0)))
   #+END_SRC

   To be able to use the abbrev table defined above, =abbrev-mode= must be
   activated.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
   (defun java-setup ()
     (abbrev-mode t)
     (setq-local compile-command (concat "javac " (buffer-name))))

   (add-hook 'java-mode-hook 'java-setup)
   #+END_SRC

** Assembler
   When writing assembler code I use =#= for comments. By defining
   =comment-start= we can add comments using =M-;= like in other programming
   modes. Also in assembler should one be able to compile using =C-c C-c=.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
   (defun asm-setup ()
     (setq comment-start "#")
     (local-set-key (kbd "C-c C-c") 'compile))

   (add-hook 'asm-mode-hook 'asm-setup)
   #+END_SRC

** LaTeX

   #+END_SRC

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

   #+END_SRC

   I prefer to use =XeLaTeX=, which is a progression of LaTeX with more advanced
   typography features. =AUCTeX= don't come preconfigured with an option to run
   =XeLaTeX=.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (add-hook 'LaTeX-mode-hook (lambda()

                                                                   "%`xelatex %(mode)%' %t" TeX-run-TeX nil t))
                                             ;(add-to-list 'TeX-command-list (list "View"
                                             ;                                 "/Applications/Preview.app/Contents/MacOS/Preview %o"
                                             ;                                 'TeX-run-discard t  t :help "Run Viewer"))
                                  (setq TeX-command-default "XeLaTeX")

   =.tex=-files should be associated with =latex-mode= instead of
   =tex-mode=.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

   #+END_SRC

   I like using the [[https://code.google.com/p/minted/][Minted]] package for source blocks in LaTeX. To make org
   use this we add the following snippet.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (eval-after-load 'org
       '(add-to-list 'org-latex-packages-alist '("" "minted")))
     (setq org-latex-listings 'minted)
   #+END_SRC

   Because [[https://code.google.com/p/minted/][Minted]] uses [[http://pygments.org][Pygments]] (an external process), we must add the
   =-shell-escape= option to the =org-latex-pdf-process= commands. The
   =tex-compile-commands= variable controls the default compile command for
   Tex- and LaTeX-mode, we can add the flag with a rather dirty statement
   (if anyone finds a nicer way to do this, please let me know).

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (eval-after-load 'ox-latex
       '(setq org-latex-pdf-process
              (mapcar
               (lambda (str)
                 (concat "pdflatex -shell-escape "
                         (substring str (string-match "-" str))))
               org-latex-pdf-process)))

     (eval-after-load 'tex-mode

** Python

   [[http://tkf.github.io/emacs-jedi/released/][Jedi]] offers very nice auto completion for =python-mode=. Mind that it is
   dependent on some python programs as well, so make sure you follow the

   We need to turn the mode on here so that we can map keys further below. We
   lower the delay so that chords are not triggered too easily.

                        (def (cond ((string-match "^[[:alnum:]]\\{2\\}$" (format "%s" key))

   The code for the keys is generated from data in a named Org table, i.e. =keys=
   using a bit of Elisp code =gen-keys= and is spit out inside a code block via
   [[http://orgmode.org/manual/noweb.html][Noweb syntax]]. The same data is also used in the [[Keyboard%20shortcuts][Keyboard shortcuts]] section to
   generate the documentation. I'd like to be able to have only one place to
   change key information and have it updated wherever necessary.
